```
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      for (var j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target && i !== j) {
          return [i, j]
        }
      }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The code contains two nested loops, each iterating over the `nums` array. Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array.

### Space Complexity

The function does not use any additional space that scales with the size of the `nums` array. There are only a few fixed extra variables. Thus, the space complexity is \(O(1)\), which means it uses constant space.

It's worth noting that while this algorithm works, it is possible to reduce the time complexity to \(O(n)\) by using a hash table.


can achieve a better time complexity by using a hash table. Here's a version of the `twoSum` function that has \(O(n)\) time complexity:

```javascript
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    var map = new Map();
    for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        var complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    return null; // or throw an exception, depending on the problem's requirements
};
```

### Time Complexity

The loop iterates through the `nums` array once, and each operation inside the loop (checking if a value exists in the map, getting a value from the map, and setting a value in the map) can be done in \(O(1)\) time on average. Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array.

### Space Complexity

In the worst case, you might end up storing all the elements of the `nums` array in the map, so the space complexity is \(O(n)\).
