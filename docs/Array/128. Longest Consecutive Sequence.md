# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

[128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

## Problem

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## Solution

To address this problem, we first convert the array into a unique set. We then iterate through the array to find the beginning of each sequence. When we encounter an element that starts a sequence, we increment it and keep track of the sequence length until we reach a number not in the set. We update `longest` with the maximum of itself and the current sequence length. Finally, we return the longest sequence found.

```
function longestConsecutive(nums: number[]): number {
  // Create a set from the array to eliminate duplicates and allow O(1) lookups
  const numSet: Set<number> = new Set(nums);
  let longest = 0;

  // Iterate over each number in the array
  for (let n of nums) {
    // Check if 'n' is the start of a sequence (no preceding number in the set)
    if (!numSet.has(n - 1)) {
      let length = 0;

      // Count consecutive numbers starting from 'n'
      while (numSet.has(n + length)) {
        length++;
      }

      // Update 'longest' with the maximum sequence length found so far
      longest = Math.max(longest, length);
    }
  }

  // Return the length of the longest consecutive sequence
  return longest;
};
