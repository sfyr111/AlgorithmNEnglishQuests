# [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` _if it is a **palindrome**, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "race a car"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = " "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

## Solution
```
function isPalindrome(s: string): boolean {  
  const str = s.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/gi, '').toLowerCase();  
  let left = 0;  
  let right = str.length - 1;  
  
  while (left < right) {  
    if (str[left] !== str[right]) {  
      return false;  
    }    left++;  
    right--;  
  }  
  return true;  
};
```

## My Words
For checking if this string is a palindrome, we can utilize a two-pointer solution without extra space to solve this. We have two pointers, `left` and `right.` The `left` starts by str and the `right` at the last str position. While `left` is less than `right` to compare `str[left]` with `str[right]`, if they do not equal, return `false` otherwise, move `left`, add up one step, move `right ` cut one step, continue to compare next a couple of char. When these two pointers meet, that `left` equals `right`, so each group element is equal, ending the loop returning `true`.

Explanation: The word "for" and "utilize" were removed to make the sentence more concise.

Adjusted:

> We have two pointers, `left` and `right`. `Left` starts at the beginning of `str` and `right` at the end.

Explanation: The adjusted version is more straightforward and avoids unnecessary repetition.
