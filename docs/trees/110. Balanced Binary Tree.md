110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

## Problem

Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**

## Solution

This code checks if a binary tree is balanced. A balanced tree means the height difference between left and right subtrees for all nodes is not more than one.

Here's how it works:

- We have a helper function `dfs` that we call recursively on each node.
- If a node is `null`, we return `true` for balanced and `0` for height because an empty tree is balanced and its height is zero.
- For non-null nodes, we get balance status and height for left and right subtrees.
- We check if the current node is balanced. It is balanced if the left and right subtrees are balanced and the height difference between them is one or less.
- We return the balance status and the height for the current node. The height is the maximum of left or right subtree heights plus one for the current node.
- Finally, we call `dfs` on the root and return the balance status from the result.

So, this approach checks each subtree's balance and height in one pass, top-down, and finds if the whole tree is balanced.

```typescript
function isBalanced(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {

  function dfs(node: TreeNode) {
    if (node === null) {
      return [true, 0];
    }

    const [leftBalanced, leftHeight] = dfs(node.left);
    const [rightBalanced, rightHeight] = dfs(node.right);

    const balanced = (
      leftBalanced && rightBalanced
      && Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1
    );

    return [balanced, 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight)];
  }

  const pair = dfs(root);
  return pair[0];
};
```
