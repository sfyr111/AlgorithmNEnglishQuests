# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

[297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

## Problem

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

## Solution

To converting a binary tree into a string and then back to a tree. For 'serialize', we use a process called DFS, short for depth-first search, to go through each node. If a node is null, we add 'N' to our string. If not, we add the node's value. We do this for all nodes and then make a big string from it. For 'deserialize', we turn the string back into a tree. We split the string into parts. If a part is 'N', it means there was no node there, so we do nothing. Otherwise, we make a new node with that number. We do this for every part to rebuild the tree.

```typescript
function serialize(root: TreeNode | null): string {  
  const res: string[] = [];  
  
  function dfs(node: TreeNode | null) {  
    if (node === null) {  
      res.push('N');  
      return;  
    }  
    res.push(node.val.toString());  
    dfs(node.left);  
    dfs(node.right);  
  }  
  
  dfs(root);  
  return res.join();  
};  
  
function deserialize(data: string): TreeNode | null {  
  const vals = data.split(',');  
  
  function dfs(): TreeNode | null {  
    const val = vals.shift();  
    if (val === 'N') {  
      return null;  
    }    const node = new TreeNode(Number(val));  
  
    node.left = dfs();  
    node.right = dfs();  
    return node;  
  }  
  
  return dfs();  
};

```
