## Problem
[876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

## Solution
``
```
function middleNode(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {  
  let slow = head;  
  let fast = head;  
  
  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {  
    slow = slow.next;  
    fast = fast.next.next;  
  }  
  
  return slow;  
};
```

This problem can be solved using the two-pointer technique. Initially, we set both `slow` and `fast` pointers to the head of the list. In a while loop, we iterate over the list with `slow` moving one node at a time (`slow = slow.next`) and `fast` moving two nodes at a time (`fast = fast.next.next`). This iteration continues until `fast` or `fast.next` becomes `null`, indicating that `fast` has reached the end of the list. Since `fast` moves twice as fast as `slow`, by this time `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle of the list. Therefore, we return `slow`, which now points to the middle node.
