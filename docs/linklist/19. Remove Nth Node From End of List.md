# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

## Problem
Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Solution

```
function removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode | null, n: number): ListNode | null {  
  let dummy = new ListNode(0, head);  
  let slow = dummy;  
  let fast = dummy;  
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {  
    fast = fast.next;  
  }  
  
  while (fast !== null) {  
    fast = fast.next;  
    slow = slow.next;  
  }  
  
  slow.next = slow.next.next;  
  
  return dummy.next;  
};
```

We can solve this problem using the two-pointer technique, starting with a `dummy` node. Both `slow` and `fast` pointers are set to this `dummy` node. First, we advance the `fast` pointer by `n + 1` steps. This extra step ensures the easy removal of the `n-th` node from the end.

Then, we iterate over the linked list, moving both `slow` and `fast` pointers together until `fast` equals `null`, indicating the end of the list. At this point, `slow` is positioned just before the node that needs to be deleted. We skip over the `n-th` node by setting `slow.next` to `slow.next.next`. Finally, we return `dummy.next`, which is the new head of the list.
