# [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

## Problem

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

## Solution

```
function reverseList(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {  
  let pre = null;  
  let cur = head;  
  
  while (cur !== null) {  
    const tmp = cur.next;  
    cur.next = pre;  
    pre = cur;  
    cur = tmp;  
  }  
  return pre;  
};
```

To reverse a linked list, we walk through each node, redirecting the current node's next pointer to the previous node. We begin with prev set to null and cur set to head. A while loop is used to iterate over the list until cur is null, which indicates that we have reached the end of the list.

During each iteration:

+ We save the next node (cur.next) in a temporary variable tmp to maintain access to the next node.
+ We reverse the direction of the current node to point to the previous node by setting cur.next to prev.
+ We update prev to be the current node (cur), moving prev one node forward.
+ We move cur to the next node (tmp), continuing through the original list.
+
At the end of the loop, prev will point to the new head of the reversed list, which we then return.
