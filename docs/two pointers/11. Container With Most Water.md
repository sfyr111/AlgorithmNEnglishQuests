# 11. Container With Most Water

[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

## Solution

To solve the maxArea problem, we use a two-pointer approach: starting with one pointer at the beginning and another at the end of the `height` array, and then moving them towards each other. We calculate the area at each step, keeping track of the maximum value. The area is calculated using the width (the difference between right and left pointers) and the height (the minimum of `height[left]` and `height[right]`). We move the left pointer forward if `height[left]` is less than `height[right]`, and move the right pointer backward if `height[left]` is greater. If the heights are equal, we can move either pointer. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), as each element is visited only once. We return the maximum area recorded after iterating through the array.

```
function maxArea(height: number[]): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = height.length - 1;
  let res = 0;

  while (left < right) {
    const w = right - left;
    const h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
    const area = w * h;

    res = Math.max(res, area);

    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else if (height[left] > height[right]) {
      right--;
    } else {
      left++;
    }
  }

  return res;
}
```
