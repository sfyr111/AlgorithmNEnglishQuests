# 15. 3Sum

[15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
## Problem

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Solution

To solve the threeSum problem, we start by sorting `nums`. Then, we iterate through the array, skipping duplicates. For each unique element, we apply a two-pointer approach: setting the current element as `nums[i]`, `left` as `nums[i + 1]`, and `right` at the end. We move `left` and `right` towards each other, calculating the sum of the triplet at each step. If the sum is greater than 0, we move `right` leftwards. If it's less than 0, we shift `left` rightwards. When the sum equals 0, we add the triplet to `res` and advance `left` to the next unique element, avoiding duplicates. This process is repeated until `left` and `right` meet. Finally, we return `res`, containing all unique triplets that sum to 0.
The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to sorting (\(O(n \log n)\)) and the nested loops for the two-pointer search.

```
class Solution {
    // The threeSum function aims to find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to zero.
    threeSum(nums: number[]): number[][] {
        // This will store the resulting triplets.
        let res: number[][] = [];
        // Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
        nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

        // Iterate through the array, treating each number as the first number of a potential triplet.
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Skip over duplicates to ensure uniqueness of triplets.
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;

            // Initialize two pointers: one after the current element, and one at the end of the array.
            let l = i + 1;
            let r = nums.length - 1;

            // Continue looking for triplets while the left pointer is less than the right pointer.
            while (l < r) {
                // Calculate the sum of the current triplet.
                let threeSum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r];
                
                // If the sum is greater than zero, decrement the right pointer to reduce the sum.
                if (threeSum > 0) {
                    r--;
                // If the sum is less than zero, increment the left pointer to increase the sum.
                } else if (threeSum < 0) {
                    l++;
                // If the sum is zero, we found a valid triplet.
                } else {
                    // Add the triplet to the result array.
                    res.push([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]]);
                    // Increment the left pointer and skip over any duplicates.
                    l++;
                    while (l < r && nums[l] === nums[l - 1]) {
                        l++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // Return the array of triplets that sum up to zero.
        return res;
    }
}
