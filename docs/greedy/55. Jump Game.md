# 55. Jump Game

[55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can iterate backward to the start position at the end. We use a variable called a goal; we update the goal each iteration to the current index; if the current index value adds, the current index can reach the goal.  When iterated entire array, the goal equals the first element, then return true.

```typescript
function canJump(nums: number[]): boolean {
    let goal = nums.length - 1;
    
    for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (i + nums[i] >= goal) {
            goal = i;
        }
    }

    return goal === 0;
}
```

## Be better

To solve the "Can Jump" problem, I use a method where I start from the back of the array and move towards the front. I have a variable named `goal` that represents the index I need to reach, which initially is set to the last index of the array.

In each step, I go backwards and check if the current position can jump to the `goal`. If the current index plus its jump value is greater than or equal to the `goal`, then I update the `goal` to this current index.

I repeat this until I reach the beginning of the array. If in the end, the `goal` has moved to the starting position, it means it is possible to reach the end of the array from the start, so I return true. Otherwise, if the `goal` is not at the starting position, then I return false.
