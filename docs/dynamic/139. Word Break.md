# 139. Word Break

# [139. Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)

## Problem

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

## Solution

To solve the 'Word Break' problem, we use dynamic programming. We create a `dp` array where each element, `dp[i]`, indicates if the substring up to index `i` can be segmented into words from the dictionary. We start with `dp[0] = true` as the base case because an empty string is always segmentable.

Then, we iterate through each position in the string. For each position `i`, we check back to earlier positions `j` to see if the substring from `j` to `i - 1` matches a word in the dictionary and if `dp[j]` is true. If such a `j` exists, we set `dp[i] = true`. This process continues until the end of the string. If `dp[n]` (where `n` is the length of the string) is true, it means the entire string can be segmented into words from the dictionary.


```typescript
function wordBreak(s: string, wordDict: string[]): boolean {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);
    dp[0] = true;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if(dp[j] && wordDict.includes(s.substring(j, i))) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
};
```
