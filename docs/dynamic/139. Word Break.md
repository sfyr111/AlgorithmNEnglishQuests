# 139. Word Break

# [139. Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)

## Problem

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

## Solution

We use dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem. The `dp` array determines if a substring can be broken into words from the dictionary. The base case is `dp[0] = true` since an empty string is always breakable.

We go through the string from start to end. For each position, we look back to see if there is a way to break substring into dictionary words. If we find a word in the dictionary that matches the end of the current substring, and the part before this word can be broken, we set the current DP to true.

So, we keep doing this until the end of the string. If DP at the end of the string is true, it means the whole string can be broken using dictionary words.


```typescript
function wordBreak(s: string, wordDict: string[]): boolean {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);
    dp[0] = true;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if(dp[j] && wordDict.includes(s.substring(j, i))) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
};
```
